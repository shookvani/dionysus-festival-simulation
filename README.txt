The purpose of this project was in response to the Vanderbilt University Classics 1010 course final remix project, in spring 2025. this course was taught by Professor David A. Michelson and the TA was Miss. Stephanie Carter.

This project was built by me. The original brainstorming was between me, my friends, and ChatGPT, given the ideas of Dionysus culture and the affect it had on Greco-Roman society and more generally on the Ancient World. My original thought process was this (comes directly from my project proposal): 
        
        I have always been curious about the Greek God Dionysus and would like to involve him in the project in some way. Another aspect that I have learned about briefly in the past is that sexuality was rather fluid in Ancient Rome, and I am curious about what that was like in other cities at these times. Dionysus was known to be the god involved in many parties — after all he is the god of wine, ecstasy, insanity, etc. There are also myths that refer to his sexual relationships with people of both genders. Especially in Ancient Greece and Rome (where Dionysus / Bacchus) is most present I hope to explore the effect this has had in this mediterranean world, and ultimately in the present day. 

For context, I am a freshman looking to major in either Cognitive Science and Computer Science or Economics and Computer Science. I am ultimately interested in the real-world application of data-based algorithms to further understand human interactions and choices and how they apply to different aspects of society such as the business world and the financial market. For example, my recent endeavors in my ROTC theory class and my Cognitive Science class have me researching the effects of the framing effect, a cognitive bias that comes from the marketing of products that affect clients, and how businesses can use it to almost manipulate consumers/clients.

My goals for this project primarily revolved around one thing: finding a way to simulate these festivals by looking at specific rituals that happened (or could have happened) during the time. I also wanted to do so in a generally informative way so that any can learn from the simulation about the period. I was inspired by my friends — I wanted to find a way to have anyone run the simulation and learn about the various rituals — and then be able to run a mass simulation and understand how different attributes (happiness, devotion, etc.) can change throughout these rituals based on the information that I've learned.

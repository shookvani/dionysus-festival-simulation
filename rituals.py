rituals.py

this rituals class has been created by me, and me only, in order to compartamentalize various initation and other rites completed by the dionysus cult both in public and during the private parties. this version of the rituals class provides descriptions of the rituals based on the research, and assumed chagnes to the person that completes them dependending on the context.
